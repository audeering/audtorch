Deep learning with PyTorch_ and audio.

audtorch_ collects audio related data sets, transforms and other useful
additions that are useful.

If you are interested in PyTorch_ and audio you should also check out the
efforts to integrate more audio directly into PyTorch_:

Installation
============

audtorch_ is supported by Python 3.5 or higher. To install it run
(preferable in a `virtual environment`_):

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install audtorch

In order to have as few dependencies as possible for the package not all
packages that are needed for some functionalities are installed. If you want to
install all dependencies run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install audiofile librosa
